# Modal-Analysis-of-Fluid-Flows
In this we apply reduced order modeling techniques like Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and Dynamic Mode Detection (DMD) on datasets of fluid flow across a cylinder. 
The POD_and_DMD_1 file is the Trial 1. Very simple dataset with 200 Re. The dataset includes the vorticity values.
